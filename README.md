**Plase note** that whereever it was helpful, I used `armadillo`. Armadillo is a library for linear algebra and scientific computing with high performance standards. In every `Makefile` you may find the following flags:
```Makefile
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -std=c++11
LIBS = -larmadillo
```
Please make sure this works out with your current configuration. All the docs [here](https://arma.sourceforge.net/)
