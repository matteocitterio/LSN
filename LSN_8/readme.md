## How to use my code

The two exercises are implemented separately in the two folders `8.1/` and `8.2/`, for which the same guidelines apply:
- To compile the program hit `make`
- To clean the folder from `*.o` and `*.exe` files hit `make clean`.
- To run the program hit `./main.exe` or `make run` to compile and run simultaneously.
